# Soul Intro (to The Chicken)

A transcription of the bass and horn parts of the Soul Intro by Jaco Pastorius (or his
band) to The Chicken by Pee Wee Ellis. I found a scan of a transcription by Mark
Welcome. I re-typeset it and made a few corrections and additions.

This is typeset using the Lilypond music typesetting system.

The source file is [soul-intro.ly](soul-intro.ly). The midi and pdf are produced by
the command `lilypond soul-intro.ly`.
