# Soul Intro (to The Chicken)

A transcription of the bass and horn parts of the *Soul Intro* by Jaco Pastorius (or his
band) to *The Chicken* by Pee Wee Ellis ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJfiYdQcQtc)).
Note that this score includes only the intro,
but does *not* include *The Chicken*.

I found a scan of a transcription by Mark
Welcome. I re-typeset it and made a few corrections and additions.

This is typeset using the Lilypond music typesetting system.

The source file is [soul-intro.ly](soul-intro.ly). The midi and pdf are produced by
the command `lilypond soul-intro.ly`.

The source file was completed Wed Jul 11 01:26:35 2007.
I have made small changes, updating the syntax, when creating this repo 16 years later.
